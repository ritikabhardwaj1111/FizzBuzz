# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a popular brain-teaser for programmers. It's sometimes used as a coding exercise during technical interviews.

## PROBLEM:
Print integers 1 to N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.
